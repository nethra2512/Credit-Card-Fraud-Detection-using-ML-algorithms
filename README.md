Credit card fraud detection is a critical task in the financial industry aimed at identifying fraudulent transactions and preventing unauthorized usage of credit cards. Machine learning (ML) plays a vital role in automating this process by analyzing patterns and anomalies in transaction data to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

Following are the various steps involved:
■ Data Collection: The first step in building a credit card fraud detection system is to collect transaction data.

■ Data Preprocessing: Before applying machine learning algorithms, the transaction data needs to be preprocessed. This involves tasks such as handling missing values, balancing the dataset

■ Algorithm Selection: Once the data is preprocessed, we select suitable machine learning algorithms for classification. Commonly used algorithms include Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Neural Networks, and more.

■ Model Training: We train the selected machine learning models on the preprocessed data. During training, the models learn patterns and relationships in the data that distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

■ Model Evaluation: After training the models, we evaluate their performance using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. We typically split the dataset into training and testing sets for evaluation, ensuring that the models generalize well to unseen data.
